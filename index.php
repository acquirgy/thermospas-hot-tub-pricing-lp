                    <p>
                        This privacy policy describes how ThermoSpas Hot Tub Products, Inc. and its United
                        States-based affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, “ThermoSpas”) may handle
                        and use personal identifiable information (&#34;PII&#34;) you submit directly or
                        indirectly to ThermoSpas, whether through your use of any ThermoSpas website (each,
                        a &#34;ThermoSpas Website&#34;), your offline submission of PII to ThermoSpas, your
                        submission of PII to one or more third parties for transmission of the same to ThermoSpas,
                        or otherwise.</p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of this privacy policy is to help you make an informed decision about
                        whether to use or continue using any ThermoSpas Website, whether to submit PII to
                        ThermoSpas, and whether to continue to allow ThermoSpas to maintain your PII. If
                        you do not agree to any of the terms of this privacy policy, please (a) refrain
                        from submitting PII to ThermoSpas and (b) request that ThermoSpas remove your PII
                        from the database in which ThermoSpas stores that information. If you need to contact
                        ThermoSpas regarding this privacy policy or ThermoSpas&#39; use of PII, please direct
                        your inquiries to privacy@thermospas.com.</p>
                    <p>
                        You can browse parts of each ThermoSpas Website without telling ThermoSpas who you
                        are or revealing any personal information about yourself. However, once you give
                        PII to ThermoSpas you are no longer anonymous to ThermoSpas. Accordingly, if you
                        choose to provide ThermoSpas with PII, you consent to the storage and use of that
                        information pursuant to this privacy policy.</p>
                    <h4>
                        WHAT INFORMATION THERMOSPAS MAY COLLECT</h4>
                    <p>
                        ThermoSpas may collect any of the following information regarding you:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Personal Information. ThermoSpas may collect personal information that can be used
                            to identify you (i.e., PII). As used herein, PII may include, without limitation,
                            your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, and any other information
                            that could be used to identify you, your ordering history with ThermoSpas&#39; products
                            or services, and your shopping preferences.</li>
                        <li>Non-Personal Information. When you visit a ThermoSpas Website, ThermoSpas may collect
                            non-personal information such as your browser type, the identity of your internet
                            service provider, your computer&#39;s operating system, the URL of the previous
                            website you visited, and the IP address of the computer you are using. While none
                            of this information standing alone can be easily used to identify you, it may be
                            combined with PII you provide to ThermoSpas.</li>
                        <li>Cookies. When you visit a ThermoSpas Website, ThermoSpas may send a small text file
                            to your computer called a &#34;cookie&#34; that identifies your browser to ThermoSpas’
                            server. Many web browsers automatically accept cookies, but as part of the functionality
                            within your browser you usually can choose to decline to accept cookies if you prefer.
                            Any cookie sent to your computer by ThermoSpas in connection with your use of a
                            ThermoSpas Website does not give ThermoSpas access to your computer or to any PII.
                            If you disable your browser&#39;s ability to collect cookies from ThermoSpas, certain
                            portions of each ThermoSpas Website may not work properly during your visit to that
                            website.</li>

                        by enabling ThermoSpas to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not.</p>
                    <h4>
                        CHILDREN</h4>
                    <p>
                        ThermoSpas does not knowingly request, collect, or maintain PII from anyone under
                        the age of thirteen (13) years old without verified parental consent. ThermoSpas’
                        intention is to refrain from collecting PII from anyone under the age of eighteen
                        (18) years old, whether through a ThermoSpas Website or otherwise. If ThermoSpas
                        learns of ThermoSpas’ collection of PII from anyone under the age of thirteen (13)
                        years old without verified parental consent, ThermoSpas will remove this information
                        from the database in which ThermoSpas stores it.</p>
                    <h4>
                        SECURITY</h4>
                    <p>
                        ThermoSpas treats collected PII as an asset that must be protected and utilizes
                        security protocols and tools to safeguard and prevent PII in ThermoSpas’ control
                        from unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties may nonetheless
                        unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications concerning
                        PII maintained by ThermoSpas. Although ThermoSpas works hard to protect the privacy
                        of all PII over which ThermoSpas has control, ThermoSpas does not promise, warrant,
                        or guarantee, and thus you should not expect, that any PII you submit to ThermoSpas
                        will always remain private. Your submission, whether direct or indirect, of PII
                        to ThermoSpas is therefore done at your own risk.</p>
                    <h4>
                        DISCLOSURES TO THIRD PARTIES</h4>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Disclosures To Affiliates, Partners, And Service Providers.</strong>&nbsp;ThermoSpas
                        may disclose your PII to (a) any ThermoSpas affiliate, (b) any ThermoSpas subsidiary,
                        (c) any thirdparty authorized dealer of products manufactured and/or distributed
                        by ThermoSpas or by any ThermoSpas affiliate or subsidiary; and (d) any third-party
                        entity allowed to act as an authorized warranty service center for products manufactured

                        of these entities may use the PII you provide to ThermoSpas to contact you regarding
                        products and/or services you acquired from ThermoSpas or to discuss products and/or
                        services ThermoSpas or any ThermoSpas affiliate or subsidiary may have to offer
                        you or in which you may be interested. ThermoSpas may also disclose your PII to
                        any service provider that assists ThermoSpas in operating any ThermoSpas Website
                        and in conducting ThermoSpas&#39; business.</p>
